# How to contribute

This is a personal project of mine but I'm happy to share with others!

  * Found a bug? [Report it here!](https://github.com/MarissaB/DM-Suite/issues/new/choose)
  
## Testing

Still working on this part Tests will be included within the 

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/MarissaB/DM-Suite/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include RSpec examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

I code with a solid foundation mostly based on Clean Code.

* Use descriptive names to explain what your variables are and how you're using them.
* Functions should have one major task.
* Errors and pertinent log-worthy info should be logged during data writing transactions (see Menu Features > MenuDBHelper for examples).
* Comments should be sparse and only used when absolutely necessary

Thanks,
Marissa B.
