# DM-Suite
A suite to play around in UWP and create some D&D tools as a DM. It uses SQLite for the database.

I wanted a project to play around with UWP controls, a database, and something involving D&D. This is my slowly changing project that aspires to be a suite of tools to utilize as a DM while running D&D games. A user guide will be forthcoming as it grows.

## First module: Tavern Menus

My players - without fail - will ask what's on the menu at every tavern, bar, or restaurant they visit. I got tired of making things up on the spot so I created a module to do it for me and keep track of the lists.
